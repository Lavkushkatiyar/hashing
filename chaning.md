i am creating the simple hashtable to store data i am using the chaining
approach that goes by i'll store data using simple hashfunction and generate
index to store value .

same value -> if the index will come same for any two values , i'll put them at
the same nindex but in the nested array.

<!-- Load factor -> to handle the size of array i'll create another double lenght of
orginal array and copy the first values -->
